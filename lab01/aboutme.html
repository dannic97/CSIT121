            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a huge shark enthusiast,  my favourite species being the Greenland Sleeper shark which is famous for its centries-long lifespan
                living as long as 500 to 600 years old from some sources. I'm also a gamer by hobby and would love to make my indie game,
                part of why I also want to go into programming. I also really love learning new coding languages as well, stemming from my
                interest in learning spoken langauges like Japanese, or Spanish.

                like a goblin shark is part of a ancient family of sharks, true living fossils. As an artist, I most enjoy working with acrylic paints
