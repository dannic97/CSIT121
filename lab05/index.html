                                I have a previous history in learning and using HTML, so I have already gained a strong familiarity with tags and attributes. But here are some of some things that I hadn't known prior to this class.

                                <dd>Prior to taking this class, I had learned about various structural tags. such as:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>&lt;header&gt;</li>

                                And others, learning to further structure my webpages.

                            CSS (Cascading StyleSheet) is a language that uses selectors, attributes and values to tell a document what it should look like. I have had use of it before but with this class I gained a deeper understanding of what it was aside from being a language that just makes things look good. Especially learning more about selectors and how they can be used, such as ID selectors, Class selectors and just the 'Simple' Element selectors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Knowing more about what makes up CSS has given me more tools to apply to creative practice so that I can further master this language and create websites that are pleasing to look  at.

                            This past class has been all about responsive design. Producing webpages that are more accessible to end-users, whether they are on a Laptop or Mobile device. This way they will be able to view all content that they need or want to see from use of that website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The building blocks of responseive web design are essentially to a developer to produce a product that is appealing to the end-user. The building block include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Usage of HTML and CSS to produce well organized displays of infomration and appealing design.</li>
                            <li>Usage of Media Queries to produce a product that is available to end-users on any device they might use for it. such as a smart phone or laptop device.</li>
                            <li>Usage of CSS structural Syntax such as Grid or Flex to create a usable and appealing layouts of your webpage</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Through this assignment I learned how to use media queries to change the layout and diplay of a webpage to fit into multple devices based on the width and orientation of the device. producing accessible webpages that have different looks depending on the device. As well as the usage and trial and error of using grid or flex flows to arrange my webpage in different ways. producing an appealing outcome on my webpage.
