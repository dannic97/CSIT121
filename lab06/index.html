                    <h2>What is TeamCherry?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Team Cherry is a small independantly owned team of game developers located in Adelaide, South Australia. They have grown in popularity with the release of the game "Hollow Knight", a side-scroller, platformer style fantasy adventure that has grown in popularity. The small team advertises their game as well as posts updates on events, patches, and now the developement of Hollow Knights' sequal game, Silksong.

                    <h2>Simple and Easy to Navigate Website</h2>
                    <p>
                        My initial analysis of the websites simple hierarchial design, which was view from my laptop device gave me a pleasant user. The various resources that are provided on the websites pages within two or three clicks. The design was uniform through out and most links to external web sources opened without interupting my experience on the page by opening in a new window.

                    <h3>Recommend Cosmetic Changes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The page though simple and easy to navigate, does not meet the requirements of accessibility for users with low vision or colour blindness. As seen from accesbilitychecker.org, a putting the page at risk of a law suite by those affect by the previously mentioned vision disabillities. As well I find the colour pallete a bit lacking and harsh on my eyes, creating a variation of hues and shades, purhaps darker reds, some softer greys, or some black borders push some images of sections of the pages forward.

                    <h2>The HTML</h2>
                    <p>
                        At a glance the page looks well built, and as I am still a student, I am still inexperienced with how developers commonly use HTML to create a pages structure. Look at the document's HTML source, I am admittedly dizzy from trying to navigate a large amount of blank space as well as large number of classes used to identify different parts of the document. It looks a bit messy to my eyes and I find it difficult to interpret. That is about all I can really muster from analysing the code at this time.
